In UI, we have following elements:
1) An element for displaying score of you and of computer
2) Three buttons for player's gestures
3) Button, to reset to a new game, once the game has finished.

When pushing any of the gestures, It invokes a new round and results affect the score.
When it is a TIE, then score will not be modified.
Once any of the players has reached score of 5, the game has ended with
congratulating the winner or informing about losing.
Then gesture buttons become greyed out and new button appears to start a
new game.


1. Create UI elements
2. Add logic for playing and reseting the game.
3. Add event listeners for the buttons.
